    <h1><b>The Lord Of the Rings</b></h1>
    <h2><b>First Chapter</b></h2>
    <p>
        Because of the stories and wealth he brought back from his adventures, <b>Bilbo Baggins</b> is the most famous hobbit in Hobbiton. He is also considered a bit strange, however. The fact that he receives visits at his house, <b>Bag End</b>, from <b>Elves, Dwarves</b>, and the wizard <b>Gandalf</b> make him the object of some slight suspicion. In addition, ever since Bilbo came back to the Shire with the ring—which he has kept secret from nearly everyone—he has not seemed to age at all. In fact, he reaches his 111th birthday virtually unchanged.

    <p>
        Frodo sees little of Gandalf for seventeen years, until Frodo is nearly fifty years old. Odd rumors from the outside world begin to circulate through the Shire—<u>news about an <b>Enemy</b> whose power is again growing in the land of <b>Mordor</b>, as well as tales about <b>Orcs and Trolls</b> and other terrible creatures.</u> Though most Hobbits pay no attention to such gossip, young Sam Gamgee, <mark>who tends the garden at Bag End</mark>, is very interested.
