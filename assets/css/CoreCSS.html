<h2>3 Ways of Styling HTML</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Inline styling</li>
    <li>Internal styling</li>
    <li>External styling</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3>1- Inline styling</h3>

We open our HTML file and use the styling inside individual HTML tags. For example; " style="color : red">Hello World" -> in in the tag where it says color : red is CSS and changes text colors.

1- color -> is used to change the text color -> " style="color : red">Hello World"
2- background-color -> is used to change the background color -> " style="background-color : red">Hello World"
3- font-size -> is used the changed the font size. For example, I can make my h1 so big or so small..For SEO h1 is important. I may want a very small headline, n that case it'd be useful.
"a href="page1.html" style="font-size:20px""Hello World"/a"
4- text-align -> is used to put the text left, right, center, justify
"div style="text-align:center""Hello World"/div"

<h3>2- Internal Styling</h3>

When we use "style" tag, this effects whole page. It is usually used in "head" tag

"style
    p{
        color: red; 
        text-align:center;
        font-size: 22px;

    }
/style"

<h3>3- External Styling</h3>

If we have some styles that are used for more than one html page, we save them in a folder. We create a folder called style.css and connect to the other html files where styles are used.

"link rel="stylesheet" href="./CoreCSS.html"""

link is a tag. rel is a relation. we say connect my  stylepage to the html page we want to relate to...we can relate this stylesheet to as many page as we want.

<h4>CSS selections(External)</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Select all html elements</li>
    *{
        font-size: 20px;
        text-align: center;
    }

    <br />* selects evertyhing from that htlm page we connected. After star we open-close {}, inside, we put the changes we want to make

    <li>Select and change the elements with the same tag</li>
    p{
        font-size: 20px;
        text-align: center; 
    }

    <br />Selects a the tag we choose, such as p, main, h1, etc...and changes all for example mains in thathtml
